## Welcome all!

Today's aims:

-   Provide a broad overview of malariasimulation
-   Learn how to run the model, view and plot model outputs
-   Introducing interventions
    -   Treatment
    -   Bednets
    -   Other interventions

## Not today's aims :smile: {.smaller}

-   An introduction to the Imperial college malaria model
    -   Please see key publications
-   An introduction to the software package used to create the model
    -   :package:\[individual\]
    -   Please see websites and supporting documentation for help
-   Context-specific modelling

## What is :package:\[malariasimulation\] {.smaller}

Malariasimulation is a [individual-based]{style="color:#F2AF29;"}, [mechanistic]{style="color:#1B998B;"}, [dynamic]{style="color:#984447;"} malaria transmission model.


  
  [We model each human as an individual in the modelled population]{style="color:#F2AF29;"}
  
  
  [We try to simulate the actual processes and interactions associated with malaria transmission]{style="color:#1B998B;"}
  
  
  [Many aspects of the modelled system change over time]{style="color:#984447;"}
  
## Malariasimulation structure {.smaller}

Malariasimulation captures the environment, the mosquito population and the human population

## Malariasimulation structure {.smaller}

Intervention modules can be include to capture the impact of malaria prevention and control

## Malariasimulation fitting and validation {.smaller}

Malariasimulation has been extensively fitted and validated against data to capture observed relationships between key metrics and the impact of interventions.

## Malariasimulation and context specific modelling {.smaller}

-   :package:\[malariasimulation\] is a "generic" _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria model
-   Running and exploring model outputs for generic settings is helpful to learn how to run the model, what to expect from the output and how changing parameters influences model results. 
-   Often, we want to apply the model to a specific setting (e.g. a country, a trial site).
-   Context specific runs are more complex and require lots of specific input data. We have software pipelines to support this work (contact Pete Winskill for more information).

## Let's give it a try!

-   :package: \[malsimtutorial\] has interactive tutorials. You can run code within the tutorial window (or in R/Rstudio if desired).
-   Run `mvw::run_tutorial("Introduction")`
