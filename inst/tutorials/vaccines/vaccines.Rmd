## Vaccination

Now that you have been introduced to malariasimulation, we will review a few vaccine use cases that might be helpful. This tutorial is largely based on the malariasimulation vaccine [vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/malariasimulation/articles/Vaccines.html)-- refer to this for more practice! 

We can use malariasimulation to implement a theoretical transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) or a pre-erythrocytic vaccine. Vaccines can be administered using either a mass vaccination strategy or an age-based strategy. 

To carry this out, we can utilize the functions `set_pev_epi()` or `set_mass_pev().` For the purposes of this training, we will focus on the administration of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine (IE, RTS,S or R21).

Here is a schematic of what we will carry out:

![](images/vaccines_malsim_tutorial.png){width=100%}

First, let's look at the vaccine efficacy parameters for RTS,S. These are saved within malariasimulation:

```{r efficacy_profile, exercise = TRUE}

malariasimulation::rtss_profile # Parameters for the first three doses of RTS,S

malariasimulation::rtss_booster_profile # Parameters for the fourth (booster) dose of RTS,S
```

These parameters are used to model the relationship between antibody titre and vaccine efficacy, based on previous modelling work conducted in the [group](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37080831/). The meaning of these parameters can be found [here](https://mrc-ide.github.io/malariasimulation/reference/create_pev_profile.html) -- you will likely not need to modify them directly, but know that these parameters impact the magnitude and duration of vaccine impact. 

```{r quiz1, echo= FALSE}

quiz(caption = "Vaccine Efficacy Question",
     question_numeric(
       "What is the maximum vaccine efficacy of the first three doses of the RTS,S vaccine?",
       answer(0.93, correct = TRUE), allow_retry = T, correct = "Correct! This means that the maximum efficacy against infection is 93%.")
     )

```


Now, let's obtain a set of parameters and run a baseline model. We will use `set_equilibrium()` to initialise the model at a certain EIR.

```{r baseline_model, exercise = TRUE}

# set a random seed so results are more comparable between runs
set.seed(780)

year<- 365
sim_length <- 3 * year
human_population <- 10000
starting_EIR <- 20

simparams <- get_parameters(list(
    human_population = human_population,
    clinical_incidence_rendering_min_ages = 0,
    clinical_incidence_rendering_max_ages = 5 * year,
    individual_mosquitoes = FALSE
  )
)

simparams <- set_equilibrium(parameters = simparams, init_EIR = starting_EIR)

# Run a model with no interventions in a setting with no seasonality
output_control <- run_simulation(timesteps = sim_length, parameters = simparams)

# Let's take a look at the model output
head(output_control)

```


## Mass vaccination strategy

We can implement a mass vaccination strategy in which all people between 5 months and 50 years old are vaccinated with 3 doses of RTS,S, followed by a booster 12 months after.

We will carry out the following steps:

- Parameterize the vaccine strategy
- Run the simulation
- Calculate incidence and parasite prevalence
- Visualize incidence and parasite prevalence over time

```{r mass_vaccination, exercise = TRUE}
month<- 30
year<- 365

rtssmassparams <- set_mass_pev(
  simparams,
  profile = malariasimulation::rtss_profile, # We will model implementation of the RTSS vaccine.
  timesteps = 1 * year,   # The single round of vaccination is at 1 year into the simulation.
  coverages = 1,          # The vaccine is given to 100% of the population between the specified ages.
  min_wait = 0,           # The minimum acceptable time since the last vaccination is 0 because in our case we are only implementing one round of vaccination.
  min_ages = 5 * month,   # The minimum age for the target population to be vaccinated. 
  max_ages = 50 * year,   # The maximum age for the target population to be vaccinated.
  booster_timestep = 12 * month, # The booster is given at 12 months after the primary series. 
  booster_coverage = 0.95,# Coverage of the booster dose is 95%.
  booster_profile = list(malariasimulation::rtss_booster_profile) # We will model implementation of the RTSS booster.
)

sim_length <- 3 * year
output <- run_simulation(timesteps = sim_length, parameters = rtssmassparams)

# Look at model output
head(output)


# process the model output to see how prevalence + incidence vary over time
# make an identifying variable for vaccine +non-vaccine scenario
output$scenario<- 'vaccine'
output_control$scenario<- 'no vaccine'

# bind control and vaccine outputs together
full_output<- dplyr::bind_rows(output, output_control)

# calculate time in years
full_output$time_year <- full_output$timestep / year

# calculate incidence in children under 5 here
full_output$clinical_incidence<- 1000* full_output$n_inc_clinical_0_1825 / full_output$n_0_1825

# calculate parasite prevalence
full_output$pfpr<- full_output$n_detect_730_3650/full_output$n_730_3650


# plot clinical incidence over time
incidence_plot<- function(full_output){
  
  ggplot(data= full_output, mapping = aes(x= time_year, y= clinical_incidence, color = scenario, fill= scenario))+
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', span= 0.25) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype= 'dotted', alpha = 10, show.legend = TRUE)+ # the year the vaccine is introduced
    theme_bw()+
  scale_color_manual(values= c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = "Clinical incidence (per 1000 children aged 0-5)",
       color= 'Scenario',
       fill = 'Scenario')

}

  
incidence_plot(full_output)

# plot parasite prevalence as well
prevalence_plot<- function(full_output){


# plot parasite prevalence over time
ggplot(data= full_output, mapping = aes(x= time_year, y= pfpr, color = scenario, fill= scenario))+
  geom_line() +
  ylim(c(0, 1))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype= 'dashed', alpha = 10, show.legend = TRUE)+ # the year the vaccine is introduced
  theme_bw()+
  scale_color_manual(values= c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) +
  labs(x = "Time (years)", 
       y = expression(paste(italic(Pf),"PR"[2-10])),
       color = 'Scenario',
       fill= 'Scenario')
}

prevalence_plot(full_output)

```

```{r quiz2, echo= FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Mass Vaccination Questions",
          question("What modelled *Pf*PR~2-10~ does the vaccine model achieve 2.5 years into the simulation?",
              answer("0.40", correct =TRUE),
              answer("0.24"),
              answer("0.12"),
              answer("0.21"), correct = "Correct-- the vaccine scenario achieves a parasite prevalence noticeably lower than the scenario where no vaccines are administered.", allow_retry = T)
)

```

## Implement your mass vaccination strategy

Use this space to implement a mass vaccination strategy that:

- Is targeted at children under 5 years old
- Includes a booster delivered 5 months after the first three doses
- Reaches a coverage level of 50% for the first three doses and 75% for the booster dose.

Plot incidence and the doses delivered for this model.

```{r space_to_work, exercise = TRUE}



```

<div id="filter-hint">
**Hint:** Use `set_mass_pev()` and modify the arguments based on the previous exercise.
</div>

```{r mass_vax_example_questions, echo= FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Mass Vaccination Example",
          question("What modelled incidence does the vaccine model achieve 1.5 years into the simulation??",
              answer("5 clinical cases per 1000"),
              answer("2.5 clinical cases per 1000", correct = TRUE),
              answer("4 clinical cases per 1000"),
              answer("2.0 clinical cases per 1000"), correct = 'Correct-- notice how clinical incidence reaches a low during this period.', allow_retry = T)
     )

```

## Age-based vaccination

Here, we will try an age-based strategy. With an age-based vaccine strategy, vaccines are administered to people at specific ages, rather than to the whole population at once.

```{r age_based, exercise = TRUE}
month<- 30
year<- 365

# Add RTS,S EPI strategy
rtssepiparams <- set_pev_epi(
  simparams,
  profile = rtss_profile, # We will model implementation of the RTSS vaccine.
  timesteps = 1 * year, # Vaccination will begin at 1 year into the simulation.
  coverages = 1, # Vaccine coverage is 100%.
  min_wait = 0, # There is no minimum wait since the last vaccination.
  age = 5 * month, # Individuals will be vaccinated once they reach 5 months of age.
  booster_timestep = 12 * month, # The booster is administered 12 months following the third dose. 
  booster_coverage = 0.95, # 95% of those vaccinated with the primary series will be boosted.
  booster_profile = list(rtss_booster_profile) # We will model implementation of the RTSS booster.
)

output <- run_simulation(timesteps = sim_length, parameters = rtssepiparams)


# now process and plot as we saw previously
# make an identifying variable for vaccine + nonvaccine scenario
output$scenario<- 'vaccine' 
output_control$scenario<- 'no vaccine'

full_output<- dplyr::bind_rows(output, output_control) # bind control and vaccine outputs together
full_output$time_year <- full_output$timestep / 365 # calculate time in years

# calculate incidence in children under 5 here
full_output$clinical_incidence<- 1000* full_output$n_inc_clinical_0_1825 / full_output$n_0_1825


incidence_plot(full_output)

```




## Implement your age-based vaccination strategy

Use this space to implement a mass vaccination strategy that:

- Vaccinates children beginning at 6 months of age, 1 year into the simulation
- Includes a booster delivered 12 months after the first three doses
- Reaches a coverage level of 42% for the first three doses and 25% for the booster dose.

Plot incidence and the doses delivered for this model.

```{r more_space_to_work, exercise = TRUE}

```

<div id="filter-hint">
**Hint:** Use `set_pev_epi()` and modify the arguments based on the previous exercise.
</div>

```{r age_based_questions, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Age-based  example",
     question("At what point does parasite prevalence begin to diverge between vaccine and non-vaccine scenario?",
              answer("3 years in"),
              answer("0.5 years in"),
              answer("2 years in", correct = TRUE), allow_retry = T))

```

If you have extra time, run the same scenario without a booster dose, and compare it to model outputs with the booster dose. How does vaccine impact change without this dose?

```{r booster_space, exercise =TRUE}


```
