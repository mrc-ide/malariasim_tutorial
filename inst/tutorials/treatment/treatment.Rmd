# Introduction

Now that we know how to set up and run basic simulations using `malariasimulation`, we can start to think about how we build interventions into our simulations and visualise how they affect malaria transmission dynamics. One such intervention is clinical treatment, or case management, in which individuals that get a clinical case of malaria are treated with an antimalarial drug.

To simulate clinical treatment in malariasimulation, there are six steps:

![](images/clinical_treatment_workflow.png){width="100%"}

1.  Load the base set of malariasimulation parameters (`get_parameters()`)
2.  Load parameters for the drug(s) of choice into our list of model parameters (`set_drugs()`)
3.  Specify the clinical treatment coverage for each drug through time (`set_clinical_treatment()`)
4.  Tune the parameters to the equilibrial state (`set_equilibrium()`)
5.  Run the simulation (`run_simulation()`)
6.  Process the simulation outputs

Using these six steps, we can simulate clinical treatment regimes that span from the very simple (single drug at a single coverage level through time) to the quite complex (multiple drugs with time-varying coverages).

## 2. Loading antimalarial drug parameters

As we saw earlier, the first step when using malariasimulation is to load a set of parameters using `get_parameters()`:

```{r load-malsim-parameters, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

# Establish a list of malariasimulation parameters:
parameters <- get_parameters(overrides = list(human_population = 1000))

```

The second step is to load the parameters for the drug(s) we want to simulate into our list of parameters. The `malariasimulation` package has in-built parameter sets for 3 drugs:

1.  Artemether lumefantrine (`AL_params`)
2.  Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (`DHA_PQP_params`)
3.  Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (`SP_AQ_params`)

We can view these parameter sets by simply calling them. Here are the parameters for artemether lumefantrine:

```{r view-inbuilt-antimalarial-parameters, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

# View the artemether lumefantrine (AL) parameter set:
AL_params

```

The parameters in these sets are:

1.  drug_efficacy: probability that treatment with the drug successfully clears the infection
2.  drug_rel_c: The onward infectiousness of a treated individual to a mosquito relative to an untreated individual
3.  drug_prophylaxis_shape: Shape parameter for a Weibull distribution describing an individuals prophylactic protection over time following treatment
4.  drug_prophylaxis_scale: Scale parameter for a Weibull distribution describing an individuals prophylactic protection over time following treatment

In the code chunk below, view the parameter sets for DHA-PQP and SP-AQ:

```{r view-drug-params, exercise = TRUE}

# View the parameters for DHA-PQP and SP-AQ:


```

```{r drug-params-quiz}
SP_AQ_params
quiz(
  question("The efficacy of DHA-PQP in the DHA_PQP_params set is 0.95000",
    answer("TRUE", correct = TRUE),
    answer("FALSE"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("The drug_rel_c of SP-AQ in the SP_AQ_params set is 4.30",
    answer("TRUE"),
    answer("FALSE", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)

```

The shape and scale parameters govern the strength and duration of the prophylactic protection provided by the drug.

![](images/drug_prophylaxis_curve.png){width="100%"}

Looking at the plot above, answer the following question:

```{r drug-prophlaxis-quiz}
SP_AQ_params
quiz(
  question("The drug that provides protection for the longest is",
    answer("SP-AQ", correct = TRUE),
    answer("AL"),
    answer("DHA-PQP"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("The drug_rel_c of SP-AQ in the SP_AQ_params set is 4.30",
    answer("TRUE"),
    answer("FALSE", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)

```

To simulate the use of a drug in `malariasimulation`, we load them into the parameters list. This is done using the `set_drugs()` function. Note that the drug parameters (e.g. `AL_params`) must be passed to `get_drugs()` as a list.

```{r using-set-drugs, exercise = TRUE, eval = TRUE}

# Establish a list of malariasimulation parameters:
parameters <- get_parameters() 

# Load the parameters for artemether lumefantrine into the parameters
parameters <- set_drugs(parameters = parameters, drugs = list(AL_params))

# View the parameters for AL:
parameters$drug_efficacy

```

The final line of the chunk above shows us how we can view the drug parameters currently loaded the parameters list once they have been appended. When simulating interventions that use antimalarial drugs (e.g. clinical treatment), this can provide a useful check to ensure you have loaded the drug parameters correctly. In the chunk below, view the `drug_rel_c` parameter:

```{r view-drug-in-params, exercise = TRUE}

# Establish a list of malariasimulation parameters:
parameters <- get_parameters() 

# Load the parameters for artemether lumefantrine into the parameters list:
parameters <- set_drugs(parameters = parameters, drugs = list(DHA_PQP_params))

# View the drug_rel_c parameter for DHA-PQP:


```

## 3. Setting clinical treatment

Now that we know how to load antimalarial drug parameters we can specify how they will be administered to the population. In malariasimulation, we parameterise clinical treatment using the `set_clinical_treatment()` function (run `?set_clinical_treatment()` to view the help file for the function). `set_clinical_treatment()` requires four arguments:

1.  `parameters`: A list of `malariasimulation` parameters (with parameters for drug(s) loaded using `set_drugs()`)
2.  `drug`: The indices of the drug which we are parameterising clinical treatment for
3.  `timesteps`: A vector of timesteps on which we want to update clinical treatment coverage
4.  `coverages`: A vector of clinical treatment coverages (proportion of the clinical infections that will be treated in each timestep).

Note that we need to call `set_clinical_treatment()` for each drug that we are specifying clinical treatment for, and that the `timesteps` and `coverage` inputs need to be vectors of equal length, such that each update to the coverage has a corresponding timestep on which the update should take place. The following chunk shows how to set up and run a simulation with clinical treatment:

```{r set-clin-treat-example, exercise = TRUE}

# Establish a list of malariasimulation parameters:
parameters <- get_parameters(overrides = list(human_population = 1000)) 

# Load the parameters for artemether lumefantrine into the parameters
parameters <- set_drugs(parameters = parameters, drugs = list(AL_params))

# Specify a clinical treatment regime for artemether lumefantrine:
parameters <- set_clinical_treatment(parameters = parameters, drug = 1, timesteps = c(0, (1 * 365) + 1), coverages = c(0, 0.6))

# Tune the parameter set to an initial EIR:
parameters <- set_equilibrium(parameters = parameters, init_EIR = 8)

# Run the simulation:
clinical_treatment_simulation <- run_simulation(timesteps = 3 * 365, parameters = parameters)

# Plot the prevalence through time:
clinical_treatment_simulation |>
  ggplot(aes(x = timestep, y = n_detect_730_3650/n_730_3650)) +
  geom_line(colour = "deepskyblue2", linewidth = 1.2) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Time (days)", y = "Prevalence (2-10)")+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = (1 * 365) + 1, linetype = "dashed")
  

```

```{r quiz2}

quiz(
  question("Drug parameters must be loaded into set_drugs() as a list?",
    answer("TRUE", correct = TRUE),
    answer("FALSE"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("If we want to specify clinical treatment regimes for three drugs, how many times must we use set_clinical_treatment()?",
    answer("1"),
    answer("2"),
    answer("3", correct = TRUE),
    answer("4"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
   question("If we input the vector c(0, 365, 720) as the argument for timesteps into set_clinical_treatment(), which of the following vectors would NOT work for the coverages argument?",
    answer("c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)"),
    answer("c(0, 0, 0)"),
    answer("c(0.9, 0.4, 0.1)"),
    answer("c(0, 0.5)", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)

```

## 4: Putting it all together

Awesome, that's all of the basics for running `malariasimulation` simulations with clinical treatment. For the final exercise, I want you to run two simulations to look at the effect of clinical treatment on malaria transmission dynamics.

The first simulation is a baseline scenario with the following criteria:

1.  `human_population` size of 10000
2.  Equilibrate the parameters to an initial EIR of 8 (refer the "introduction" tutorial if you need to!)
3.  Run the simulation for 5 years

The second simulation will use what we've learnt to simulate clinical treatment with the following criteria:

1.  Set the `human_population` parameter to 10000
2.  Load the parameters for dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DHA-PQP)
3.  Initiate clinical treatment with a coverage of 0.4 at the end of year 1
4.  Increase the coverage to 0.8 at the end of the third year
5.  Equilibrate the simulations with an initial EIR of 8
6.  Run the simulation for 5 years

Plot the *Pf*PR~2-10~ for each simulation and compare the outputs!
